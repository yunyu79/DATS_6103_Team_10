# DATS 6103 Endterm Project - On Time Delivery Prediction

This repository encompasses the Master of Science in Data Science's DATS6103 subject's end-term project for Semester 1 in Fall 2022.

With the rise of e-commerce, people enjoy the convenience of that. For any e-commerce business to thrive, it needs to figure out what will help build a customer base and, in turn, profits. Among all the factors, the one that favors the growth of any e-commerce company is the timely delivery of products. According to an e-commerce survey conducted in 2015, 66% of customers preferred one retailer over another because of delivery services, which can come off as a potential loss for other businesses in the same domain.

Our project aims at solving the aforementioned problem for e-commerce businesses in two ways:1. Performing a detailed exploratory data analysis that brings out the best of the dataset, and2. Implementing a medley of machine learning algorithms to find the best algorithm with accurate prediction of whether a product will get delivered on time or not based on the product's attributes.

We have implemented the above solution altogether using the following **language tools, algorithms, and techniques** - **Python, Visual Studio Code, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Hypothesis Testing, Scikit-Learn, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, RandomizedSearchCV.**
